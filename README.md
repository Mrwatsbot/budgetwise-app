# BudgetWise 🎮💰

**The financial fitness game that makes you richer.**

Budget, track debt, build wealth — and watch your Financial Health Score level up. AI coaching tells you what to do next. Achievements and streaks keep you coming back.

## What Makes BudgetWise Different

- **Financial Health Score (0-1000)** — A personal tracker that tells you if you're getting better with money. Direction matters more than snapshots.
- **Gamification** — Steam/Xbox-style achievements with rarity, streaks, challenges, and leaderboards. Built by a game developer.
- **AI Coach** — Every insight ties to your score. "Do X → your score goes up Y." Not a chatbot — a financial coach.
- **Full Budgeting Engine** — Income, spending, debt tracking, savings, bill management. Everything you need under the hood.
